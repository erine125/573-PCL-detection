You don't know how much of a shadow this incident has cast on their entire lives, and you don't know whether they have completely changed their life path because of it. They are still children. Imagine if you were locked up in a school where you were bullied for three years, would you still be strong, would you still study well, would you still think that society is a good place?",0
" Looking at universities across the country, I feel that there are very few leaders who truly care about students. Leaders only think about political achievements and interests, and they want to keep their positions and look for opportunities to climb up. Students are nothing in their eyes, just a vulnerable group. To put it bluntly, students are tools. Only the policies themselves can benefit them, and the benefits to students are incidental. Cockroach nests are everywhere. The difference is their size, whether they are annoying or not. I think there is little difference in essence.",0
 Marx also said that you have to have your own strength to do socialism,0

I looked up Baidu and found that it was said by Helen Keller. It turns out that only people with experience can have such a deep understanding. I have remembered this sentence for many years. Whenever I am dissatisfied, I will think of this sentence. What I don’t care about may be what others dream of.",0
 China's system is always something that can reflect its unique talents.,0
 I guess no one will go to this university this year.,0
" The public facilities for disabled people in China are indeed terrible! There are also perfunctory firefighting public equipment and some firefighters and their amateurs. I call for urban planning to take disabled people and other special groups into consideration, and for the maintenance of public facilities to not be too perfunctory, such as replacing broken bricks with other bricks, or just applying cement. I hope that the maintenance of urban public facilities can be more professional, and you can refer to the German road maintenance.",0
 The most terrifying thing is that people turn a blind eye to such things!,1
"But I think taking out the trash, bringing something, or pouring a glass of water is just a piece of cake. And if you are new here, wouldn’t you be criticized for not being diligent in doing small things? (My personal opinion is laughable.",0
" How do you judge whether the students who are fighting are telling the truth or not? Even if they are telling the truth and you hurt someone, do we still invoke the right of self-defense? Do we have to open a court for you? If we really want democracy, such matters need to be judged by the dean of discipline, the class teacher, and the student representatives. Regardless of whether it is fair or not, the result will definitely be recognized by the majority of students. This is definitely impossible and unrealistic.",1
" Why not eat meat? Do you know how expensive social security fees are? 5,000 yuan a year. If there is no company to help pay the fees, isn’t it expensive for a single household to pay? 5,000 yuan for one person, 10,000 yuan for two people. If a family just breaks even every year, do you know what this 10,000 yuan means? Such a family only spends about 10,000 yuan a year to raise a child. You can say they are short-sighted, but life is forced, so there is no need to blame them, right?",0
" ""Abandoned by family"" is not difficult to understand, right? Is it possible that she also wants to go to school?",0

" Hug you, luckily everything is over! I have also encountered it. But I am not as domineering and courageous as you!",0
" This society is a place where the strong prey on the weak. People who are easily bullied are usually good-for-nothings. To put it nicely, it means they are willing to help others. To put it bluntly, it means they don’t know how to cherish themselves. In society, I think we should first learn to judge and protect ourselves.",0

"What you did was right. Human nature is evil. They see that you are easy to bully, so they keep getting worse and worse and challenge the bottom line. When you resist a little, they will back off. This is what I gradually realized when I grew up. I changed from a person who believed that human nature is good to a person who believed that human nature is evil. I will also teach my children in the future that when someone bullies you, fight back, and fight back hard.",0
 Because they don't want to eat tree bark or grass roots.,0
" Me too. I live with my grandparents. Ever since my grandpa got dementia, he has been slandering the family for taking money and wanted to divorce my grandma. He does this every day. Then he had high blood pressure and ate nonsense and went to the hospital. All of us followed him in to take care of him. Afterwards, he continued to do things like that. I really don't know what to do. You can't hit him, old man.",0
" All schools are like this. When something breaks out, the first thing they think of is not to solve it, but to put pressure on it to suppress it.",0
" My grandma is like this. If she can't wake you up, she'll twist the doorknob and bang on the door, and sneeze on the food. She thinks that my job is easy, that it's easy to make money, and that I'm not exposed to the wind or rain. She has no idea how much pressure I'm under.",0
"Hahaha, I finally understood why parents beat and scolded us for our studies at all costs. It's a pity that many people understand it too late and can only pin their regrets of their youth and ignorance on their children. When children are disobedient, can they see themselves who were ignorant of the world back then?",0
" I was bullied in junior high school, and I still have the trauma of it now that I am in my third year of high school. I rarely go to crowded places. I really can't get out of it.",0

 Safety is very important nowadays. The first thing we say when we go out for patrol is to pay attention to safety.,0
" We were both bullied at school, but the teachers and parents thought it was a small matter and just dealt with it hastily.

" If you are hit, don't fight back, the noble person in your life is here",0
 Why not be a volunteer for the society [Why not eat meat],0
" This is not the case. Most girls who talk about leaving the father and keeping the child are actively ""leaving the father"" rather than being forced to ""keep the child"". What's more, many people make this choice based on their certain financial ability. On the other hand, the actions of this single mother are indeed... walking on a minefield at every step.",0
Are you feeling better now?,0
" Serious nonsense, or just don't change",0
" There is no hint, you can look up my answer.",0
 This kind of teacher doesn't care? [Angry],0
 I think CCTV intervened to cover up another incident.,0

" Why do I feel like you are talking about me? I am from the south and married a northern man. The customs are the same. When I go to their house during the Chinese New Year, I have to go to a hotel to take a shower the next day. I eat dumplings for three meals a day. I haven't seen his family take a shower or wash clothes in the whole winter. This can be tolerated. After all, it is only half a month at most. If the parents-in-law come to live with you, it will be terrible.",0
" Simple and crude, I like it [agree]",0
"When I was a child, I experienced cold violence between girls. I was sensitive and anxious all the time. From elementary school to junior high school, and then until high school, I stopped talking and developed mental illness. If I had to choose between being a child and an adult, I would definitely choose to be an adult, because children are more likely to be anxious, sensitive and sad. I can still clearly feel the anxiety, worry and tension I had when I was a child.",0
 It's the same in my family. My grandmother is from the countryside and can't read a single word. She never flushes the toilet after using it. She even smeared her feces all over my aunt's toilet. It's helpless.,0
" It's very simple. If you want to have fun, there must be a price. If you want to live a rich life, there must be a price. It would be a big problem if the rich in the United States lived a rich life without working hard!",1
" Looking at many elderly people working in construction, their bodies covered in mud, they eat lunch and dinner at nearby small restaurants every day.

 The disadvantaged groups I understand are those who are neither full nor starving.,0
" The United States is really bad, a bunch of scumbags are in high positions",0
 The reverse is beautiful. I feel relieved when I see you hit her.,0
"But why don’t you care about other people’s behavior? Now I am being isolated and targeted by the small group that I used to hang out with. I don’t even understand what is wrong with me that they can call me such ugly words... Now when I go back to the dormitory, I don’t even say a word and listen to their sarcastic remarks, pointing their finger at me. I'm so sad...I don't have many friends in the class now, and I have to go to class with them. Because of this, I can't sleep well, can't study well, and can't control myself all the time.",0
" Support you, if only I was as brave as you before",0

So how do you drive at night?,0
 Defining reading and poverty alleviation,0
" This cannot be accepted. The consumption capacity in rural areas is so small. There is almost no floating population. Who can they sell to? The consumers are few and fixed. That scene will not be interesting. When transportation can be conveniently covered in rural areas, there is no need to wait for people to run away because they can't afford to eat.",1

 Deduction 1: Uncover the true face of society [difficult],0
" This is the truth, but building facilities for the disabled would have wasted a lot of money on building a gymnasium. A little trick to waste +1 has focused more attention on marginalized groups, but the rights of the majority of people have been reduced again.",0
" Everyone has flaws, but some people's flaws are more obvious. God is fair, and there may be something better waiting for you.",0
The woman in her 50s who lives behind my house is a low-income household. She starts sweeping the road at 4 a.m. in the middle of winter and finishes at dawn. She picks up scraps during the day. Don’t ask me how I know this. I used to work all night and often met her when I went home in the morning.,0
" In fact, it’s usually just enough to eat, and she always complains about cooking too much and covers her face.]",0

The problem was that after cleaning, I was not given time to change clothes at all. I was sitting in the cafeteria.

But if child labor is legal, there will be many more children who drop out of school and work on the streets. Others are only 15 years old, and you people want them to work from now on.
