I called the police but they didn't come to the scene in time. There were surveillance cameras everywhere but they didn't check them. I called the police thinking there would be a little hope, but they didn't expect the police to care about you. They just filed a case and said to wait for notification in a week. When I called to ask about the progress, their attitude was very bad and they said they would notify me if there was any situation.

So I think the comments that everyone has psychological problems are correct, but single parents focus on the relationship between men and women.",1

No one really wants to be bad from the bottom of their heart, and the so-called bad behavior is also a way to find sustenance for their current situation.",1

Then they use their experience, which is not even their own experience, to make things clear, and they become angry when it is pointed out to you. Are you arguing or are they arguing?",0

I used to not believe in this marriage theory, but after meeting a man and woman who were very insecure in their relationship and it affected their relationship, I later found out that he was a single parent. When I meet an insecure man again, I guess that he is a single parent. If you can't feel it, don't consider whether he is a single parent. It's like whether food is spoiled or not.

"In this case, you need to ask his family or guardian, because he himself is not easy to communicate. People like this are basically level two disabled or above, and they should basically have minimum living allowances. Needless to say, minimum living allowances are given as gifts. I didn't know about it before and I couldn't say that it didn't exist, but now it is unlikely. We basically have a good number of low-income households, disabled people, and elderly people in need in our jurisdiction, and the grassroots staff are very familiar with their family situations.",2

"Your serious de facto marriage is really outdated. If you don't get a replacement certificate, the law will consider it cohabitation. If there is a dispute, it will only be handled as cohabitation. Chinese law has long taken folk customs into consideration, so before 1994, it was considered okay to hold a wedding banquet. Now it is a new era and the law needs to be popularized. After 1994, you need to wait until you reach the legal age to get a certificate. It's ok to hold a wedding banquet first, why don't you get a replacement certificate?",0

Now many people take the law too rigidly. The laws of any country must stand on public order and good customs. In China's public order and good customs, if there is no marriage certificate but the family has a wedding banquet and both parents agree, it is a de facto marriage.",1

There are also certain differences in the psychology of children raised by grandparents and children raised by parents.,1
"If the boy is a single parent, some mothers who have raised him since childhood cannot let him grow up, and may even feel that a woman has snatched her son away from them, and she will still have the final say in the family, which is quite strong.

It is clearly stated above that petitioning and appealing beyond the level of the government are all illegal. Some so-called wage-demanding migrant workers who were bribed by the contractors surrounded the government and held banners to threaten the staff. They must and should be severely punished.,2

"Perhaps it would be more accurate to change it to a ""utilitarian perspective"". Because from an ethical perspective, ""utilitarianism"" pursues the maximization of happiness, which is not only personal but also social. We will not stand by and watch someone die. On the surface, it seems to be an altruistic behavior, but in fact, it can also be considered from the perspective of selfishness, because if we stand by and watch someone die, our soul will be tormented. So we save people for our own peace of mind, which is a selfish perspective.",0

"A good friend of mine suffered from school violence since she was a child. She learned Taekwondo and boxing to protect herself. Unexpectedly, she couldn't stop learning. She became a third-degree black belt and no one dared to bully her anymore. In fact, school violence is not terrible. First of all, you must have a sense of resistance and don't accept it. Kind people are afraid of being bullied. Kind horses are ridden. People with bare feet are not afraid of wearing shoes. The world is also like this.

"Personally, I feel that the question is not whether children from disadvantaged families can have entertainment, but that most children from disadvantaged families can neither study well nor play well, because both playing and studying require capital investment. Children from rich families can also gain knowledge when they play, but children from disadvantaged families can only play foolishly if they do not study hard.",1
"I have a marriage certificate and I am forced to be a single parent, leaving the father behind and keeping the son. Men are irresponsible. What can women do?

"Because Chinese manufacturing is still at the middle and low end of the entire international division of labor industry chain, and we all want to live a life like the middle class in Europe and America. So what society needs, what we want, and the actual situation of the country are intertwined.

"You are wrong. You are not the child who was bullied. You don't know what kind of humiliation they have suffered. You don't know how much of a shadow this incident has cast on their entire lives, and you don't know whether they have completely changed their life path because of it. They are still children. Imagine if you were locked up in a school where you were bullied for three years, would you still be strong, would you still study well, would you still think that society is a good place?",0
"Looking at universities across the country, I feel that there are very few leaders who truly care about students. Leaders only think about political achievements and interests, and they want to keep their positions and look for opportunities to climb up. Students are nothing in their eyes, just a vulnerable group. To put it bluntly, students are tools. Only the policies themselves can benefit them, and the benefits to students are incidental. Cockroach nests are everywhere. The difference is their size, whether they are annoying or not. I think there is little difference in essence.",0
Marx also said that you have to have your own strength to do socialism,0

The key is that socialism still doesn't care about the working people at the bottom,0
I'm afraid the next step will be to tear off the skin and use force,0
You are a bit simple-minded. Don't you consider whether you can bear the pressure of life in the future? Don't you hurry up and do it while the month is still young?,3
Of course I can see it. The disadvantaged groups in sanitation work so hard.,0

Some people in rural areas have been abandoned by society. They can only live in their own small piece of land. They cannot survive outside their own circle. There is no way to change it. This is the current situation of rural elderly people.,0

So what is the adjective to describe the questioner's child who can't find his father? I'm curious about the father but the son.,0
"Holding people accountable is obviously a good thing, but if, as the answerer said, you are afraid of being held accountable and you go all the way,",0
"Alas, I think sometimes bullying between girls is also very scary. I will always remember those idiots in junior high school. They relied on their family background to bully their classmates.

I looked up Baidu and found that it was said by Helen Keller. It turns out that only people with experience can have such a deep understanding. I have remembered this sentence for many years. Whenever I am dissatisfied, I will think of this sentence. What I don’t care about may be what others dream of.",0
China's system is always something that can reflect its unique talents.,0
I guess no one will go to this university this year.,0
"The public facilities for disabled people in China are indeed terrible! There are also perfunctory firefighting public equipment and some firefighters and their amateurs. I call for urban planning to take disabled people and other special groups into consideration, and for the maintenance of public facilities to not be too perfunctory, such as replacing broken bricks with other bricks, or just applying cement. I hope that the maintenance of urban public facilities can be more professional, and you can refer to the German road maintenance.",1
The most terrifying thing is that people turn a blind eye to such things!,2
"But I think taking out the trash, bringing something, or pouring a glass of water is just a piece of cake. And if you are new here, wouldn’t you be criticized for not being diligent in doing small things? (My personal opinion is laughable.",0
"How do you judge whether the students who are fighting are telling the truth or not? Even if they are telling the truth and you hurt someone, do we still invoke the right of self-defense? Do we have to open a court for you? If we really want democracy, such matters need to be judged by the dean of discipline, the class teacher, and the student representatives. Regardless of whether it is fair or not, the result will definitely be recognized by the majority of students. This is definitely impossible and unrealistic.",3
"Why not eat meat? Do you know how expensive social security fees are? 5,000 yuan a year. If there is no company to help pay the fees, isn’t it expensive for a single household to pay? 5,000 yuan for one person, 10,000 yuan for two people. If a family just breaks even every year, do you know what this 10,000 yuan means? Such a family only spends about 10,000 yuan a year to raise a child. You can say they are short-sighted, but life is forced, so there is no need to blame them, right?",0
"""Abandoned by family"" is not difficult to understand, right? Is it possible that she also wants to go to school?",1

"Hug you, luckily everything is over! I have also encountered it. But I am not as domineering and courageous as you!",0
"This society is a place where the strong prey on the weak. People who are easily bullied are usually good-for-nothings. To put it nicely, it means they are willing to help others. To put it bluntly, it means they don’t know how to cherish themselves. In society, I think we should first learn to judge and protect ourselves.",0
"Can I join the disadvantaged group? [tears and laughter, tears and laughter, tears and laughter, tears and laughter] I apply to join the climate disadvantaged group. I want to marry a wife and have a baby. The future Germany will be the Germany of the yellow race.",0
"What you did was right. Human nature is evil. They see that you are easy to bully, so they keep getting worse and worse and challenge the bottom line. When you resist a little, they will back off. This is what I gradually realized when I grew up. I changed from a person who believed that human nature is good to a person who believed that human nature is evil. I will also teach my children in the future that when someone bullies you, fight back, and fight back hard.",0
Because they don't want to eat tree bark or grass roots.,0
"Me too. I live with my grandparents. Ever since my grandpa got dementia, he has been slandering the family for taking money and wanted to divorce my grandma. He does this every day. Then he had high blood pressure and ate nonsense and went to the hospital. All of us followed him in to take care of him. Afterwards, he continued to do things like that. I really don't know what to do. You can't hit him, old man.",0
"All schools are like this. When something breaks out, the first thing they think of is not to solve it, but to put pressure on it to suppress it.",0
"My grandma is like this. If she can't wake you up, she'll twist the doorknob and bang on the door, and sneeze on the food. She thinks that my job is easy, that it's easy to make money, and that I'm not exposed to the wind or rain. She has no idea how much pressure I'm under.",0
"Hahaha, I finally understood why parents beat and scolded us for our studies at all costs. It's a pity that many people understand it too late and can only pin their regrets of their youth and ignorance on their children. When children are disobedient, can they see themselves who were ignorant of the world back then?",0
"I was bullied in junior high school, and I still have the trauma of it now that I am in my third year of high school. I rarely go to crowded places. I really can't get out of it.",0
"Like you, I am also afraid of the coming of winter vacation. It is not a good feeling to be homeless. I can't shamelessly stay at other people's houses all the time.",0
The way of celebrating the New Year has indeed changed.,1
Safety is very important nowadays. The first thing we say when we go out for patrol is to pay attention to safety.,0
"We were both bullied at school, but the teachers and parents thought it was a small matter and just dealt with it hastily. The girl didn’t even apologize, and she spread all kinds of rumors about me at school after the incident. But I couldn’t do anything, and no one was willing to defend me [smile smile I became a troublemaker in everyone’s eyes",0
"I almost killed him with a knife, but it turned out to be a friendly soldier.",0
"You just want to eat free food, right?",0
There are really too few answers like this on Zhihu,0

"It's not just the disadvantaged groups in the construction industry. Ordinary factories are also starting to not want 60-percent steel plates, or even 55-percent steel plates.",0
This is China. Money can solve anything.,0
There is no way around it. The hygiene of blue-collar workers depends on the conscience of the boss and the supervision from above.,0
"If you are hit, don't fight back, the noble person in your life is here",1
Why not be a volunteer for the society [Why not eat meat],0
"This is not the case. Most girls who talk about leaving the father and keeping the child are actively ""leaving the father"" rather than being forced to ""keep the child"". What's more, many people make this choice based on their certain financial ability. On the other hand, the actions of this single mother are indeed... walking on a minefield at every step.",1
Are you feeling better now?,0
"Serious nonsense, or just don't change",0
"There is no hint, you can look up my answer.",0
This kind of teacher doesn't care? [Angry],0
I think CCTV intervened to cover up another incident.,0
"It's too real. I've seen children in rural areas of northern Anhui who are about to go to school, and their ability level is not even as good as that of three-year-old children in Haidian District [covering face]",0
"Why do I feel like you are talking about me? I am from the south and married a northern man. The customs are the same. When I go to their house during the Chinese New Year, I have to go to a hotel to take a shower the next day. I eat dumplings for three meals a day. I haven't seen his family take a shower or wash clothes in the whole winter. This can be tolerated. After all, it is only half a month at most. If the parents-in-law come to live with you, it will be terrible.",0
"Simple and crude, I like it [agree]",0
"When I was a child, I experienced cold violence between girls. I was sensitive and anxious all the time. From elementary school to junior high school, and then until high school, I stopped talking and developed mental illness. If I had to choose between being a child and an adult, I would definitely choose to be an adult, because children are more likely to be anxious, sensitive and sad. I can still clearly feel the anxiety, worry and tension I had when I was a child.",0
It's the same in my family. My grandmother is from the countryside and can't read a single word. She never flushes the toilet after using it. She even smeared her feces all over my aunt's toilet. It's helpless.,0
"It's very simple. If you want to have fun, there must be a price. If you want to live a rich life, there must be a price. It would be a big problem if the rich in the United States lived a rich life without working hard!",3
"Looking at many elderly people working in construction, their bodies covered in mud, they eat lunch and dinner at nearby small restaurants every day. These restaurants are heavy in oil and salt, which shows that most of these elderly people will die of uremia, and their savings from so many years of hard work will eventually go back into the pockets of the hospital.",1

"When my mother was in her sixties, she always boasted that she was very capable in shooting in the team. She still can't make a phone call, whether it's a smart phone or an old phone. She sometimes forgets how to answer the phone and is always unwilling to learn new things. She is almost the same as your grandmother.",0

The disadvantaged groups I understand are those who are neither full nor starving.,0
"The United States is really bad, a bunch of scumbags are in high positions",0
The reverse is beautiful. I feel relieved when I see you hit her.,0
"But why don’t you care about other people’s behavior? Now I am being isolated and targeted by the small group that I used to hang out with. I don’t even understand what is wrong with me that they can call me such ugly words... Now when I go back to the dormitory, I don’t even say a word and listen to their sarcastic remarks, pointing their finger at me. I'm so sad...I don't have many friends in the class now, and I have to go to class with them. Because of this, I can't sleep well, can't study well, and can't control myself all the time.",0
I support you. If only I had been as brave as you.,0
"To be honest, almost every school in China will deal with campus violence in a peaceful way. Many parties are unwilling to make things worse. Think about ourselves, sometimes we also take this approach. In fact, sometimes we are really helpless. Alas~",0
What exactly is degrading and objectifying women? Is it a crime to degrade and objectify men? Is it a crime for women to degrade and objectify women themselves? Is it a crime for Pan Changjiang to be degraded every year during the Spring Festival Gala?,0

So how do you drive at night?,0
Defining reading and poverty alleviation,0
"This cannot be accepted. The consumption capacity in rural areas is so small. There is almost no floating population. Who can they sell to? The consumers are few and fixed. That scene will not be interesting. When transportation can be conveniently covered in rural areas, there is no need to wait for people to run away because they can't afford to eat.",2

"This is the truth, but building facilities for the disabled would have wasted a lot of money on building a gymnasium. A little trick to waste +1 has focused more attention on marginalized groups, but the rights of the majority of people have been reduced again.",1
"Everyone has flaws, but some people's flaws are more obvious. God is fair, and there may be something better waiting for you.",0
The woman in her 50s who lives behind my house is a low-income household. She starts sweeping the road at 4 a.m. in the middle of winter and finishes at dawn. She picks up scraps during the day. Don’t ask me how I know this. I used to work all night and often met her when I went home in the morning.,0
"In fact, it’s usually just enough to eat, and she always complains about cooking too much and covers her face.]",0

Don't let us stop a fight and end up being called to the police station to record our statements. It's bad luck. I think this passage makes a lot of sense. What's wrong with having a good reason?",3

Didn’t your teacher teach you when you were a child that “only those who endure the most hardships can become superior people”? Isn’t the reason why Chinese people study to become “superior people”?,0

When my classmates discussed this, they just said, ""Don't have sex with women who have had sex with xx people."" Even if there are 500 gay men, I don't care. You can say that the conclusion is wrong. I can admit that I am gay, but I didn't focus on this for a second.",0

"I am also convinced that people who do not improve their skills but only think about earning wages will be out of their business. If there is no more wages to earn, it will be the right thing to do.",0
You were lost in thought. So if you married a woman you would clean up the house yourself?,0
"I totally agree. When I was on a business trip in the company, I cleaned the company trash cans. The smell was indescribable. The problem was that after cleaning, I was not given time to change clothes at all. I was sitting in the cafeteria. My squad leader was almost out of food, but he still let me finish my meal first and then go back to change clothes. Although I always think he is not a good person, he did very well in some aspects.",0

The language she used in her posts on Alibaba's internal website is a bit disgusting.,0
"Miss, you are actually quite good. I am a single male from the countryside born in 1994, with no car or house. Sometimes I feel that it is really hard for boys, and it is even harder for the first generation of boys who have left the countryside. They can't let go, can't leave, can't stay.",0
"At that time, people like us would be sweeping the streets after we got old and retired. It’s really scary when you think about it!",0

"The disabled said it was really heartbreaking. My classmate went out last time because there was a slope and he couldn't get up.

"In Hubei, it is called ""Lei Fei"" in the local dialect. There is a group of hooligans at the entrance of the primary school, who directly ask students for money. If they don't give, they will search them and beat them.

Analysis without considering the actual situation is basically useless.,0
Give me some money or something [laughs],2
"A certain national tax service unit (a state-owned enterprise engaged in anti-counterfeiting and tax control, which can be found by searching on the Internet) also started outsourcing labor in 2016, saying that the salary levels and welfare benefits are the same as those of regular employees, but in fact the gap is widening little by little.",0

"The future is too far away, and entertainment is too close. In a low-desire environment, I don’t think about any lofty ideals at all. Compared with reading and studying, and blending with the souls of the giants of the times, I am more likely to be controlled by the pleasure brought by the momentary dopamine in front of me. I will remember to work hard for a while, but I will doubt the value of my efforts. Everything can be infected by negative emotions. Damn~",0

"I'm not sure if my grandma has Alzheimer's, but she keeps asking about what I just said. She keeps asking me when I go to school seven or eight times. Because she lives close to our house, she comes to my house three or four times a day. I don't know what she wants to see, but she also shouts at my house to see if my parents are home. And my dad has irregular working hours, but she keeps asking me. I really can't stand it. Now when she comes to shout at me, I get angry.",0

No matter what, these school animals are judging everything from a moral high ground. Anyway, as long as it doesn't affect their careers, they don't care about the life and death of your students.",0
"It's not just students, it's the same for public security management. If you get hit, as long as you fight back, it's a fight, both sides will get 50 lashes, as for fairness? What does fairness for dogs have to do with fairness for humans?",0
"Acting? When someone commented like this, I didn't know what to say to suppress my urge to curse. Life is a play! Why don't you play a role where the premise is that you are also helpless and live just to live, okay?",0

"It's better to have money. If you have money, you can hire a good lawyer. If you don't have money, just go to jail.",0
"Let me say a few words about why most of the passers-by did not offer help in this situation. It is fundamentally a legal issue. When domestic violence can really be criminalized and implemented in judicial practice, and when social opinion and public awareness are truly accepted, will someone be willing to care about real or fake fights between couples and quarrels between lovers.",1
"Well, there is nothing we can do. They said they came to build Beijing and contribute to us. They left their hometowns and are heroes. So why should they follow the Beijingers in the lottery? Why should we restrict them from buying houses? Why should we sell them houses at one-tenth of the price if we do not give them preferential policies for buying houses? These opinions come from my weird colleagues from other places.",0
There are still too many Chinese people. It would be better if 80% were reduced. It would be best if 90% of the remaining people were ethnic minorities.,0
"Yes, there is nothing I can do but watch.",0
"It's so strange. When I was a kid, I didn't dare to sleep in during holidays. My parents would wake me up even if they had nothing to do, otherwise they would scold me for being lazy for no reason. Later, when I went to a classmate's house to play, she would sleep in on her weekends. Then I realized that there are such tolerant parents.",0

"This age limit has existed for a long time, and it is consistent with the retirement age of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security. You only think that they are excluded from the construction industry, but do you know how much higher the probability of sudden death is for the elderly people in disadvantaged groups who still work on construction sites? Some people fall to the ground while walking on the way to work early in the morning, some sleep in the board room and cannot get up, some die in the toilet. These situations happen frequently on construction sites, and many of them are even under 60 years old.",1

I was isolated when I was in college, and then I became friends with another roommate who was also isolated. I treat her well and she treats me well. I just want to have a companion. We don’t have to be friends. People with different personalities don’t have to force themselves to get together. Don’t care about other people’s opinions. Just be yourself!",0
"Yes, to put it simply, studying is anti-human, especially in adolescence. The rich are more advantageous because they can use material things to induce their children to study, while the disadvantaged groups can only rely on low-cost methods.",0

"My grandmother is a bit like this, and there are many people of that generation like this. I often wonder: if there is a robot to chat with her all day, listen to her, and respond to her tirelessly, would it be better? They are uneducated and have no entertainment.

"When they were young, we told them to be obedient and sensible, and to be good people; when they grew up, we found that this is a world where the strong prey on the weak and follow the law of the jungle; if we don’t teach them good things every day, isn’t it just cutting off the wings of a bird and letting it fly away?

When I see people who emphasize themselves too much, I will be indifferent and resist them. And those who show the evil of human nature should be hated. Facing the law of the jungle, you can be helpless and cautious, but I don't agree with the idea that obeying the law of the jungle is mature and proud of it.

"It's not illegal to work for a job, but it's illegal to hire a company. The legally protected object has become a lawbreaker. Do you disrespect women so much? Do girls have to exchange sex for resources when they reach a certain age? This assumption is malicious enough. The reality is that girls over 14 don't sell their youth on the streets. But if child labor is legal, there will be many more children who drop out of school and work on the streets. Others are only 15 years old, and you people want them to work from now on. Do you think they will lose the right to go to school from now on?",0

"The first story is basically just a story. Liu Dongqiang is definitely not the kind of person who can achieve enlightenment and master the true meaning of life and work hard just because of a 4,000 yuan trip. It's just inspirational chicken soup for the masses. Believe me, a 4,000 yuan trip to a tourist attraction really can't help you grasp the true meaning of life.

"But I still want to say that the most effective way to avoid being bullied is to harden your character, dare to refuse and dare to resist. Only in this way can you prevent such things from happening to yourself. Fortunately, this is in school. If you are bullied, the school will not help you, but the society and netizens will help you. If you go to society and companies, your colleagues and leaders bully you invisibly, and then it will be difficult to find evidence for you to ask netizens to help you.",1
"I laughed when I saw this picture. Those who are willing to understand will understand, don't expect too much. The most annoying thing is the kind of ""What's wrong with you? There are people who are worse off than you. Haha~ Friend, how can I respond? Should I comfort you instead?",0

Most people don't know the actual implementation of the law. The result of the Kamikaze car logo in Kaili, Guizhou has just come out. If the young man feels that it is unreasonable, what will be the result of the administrative review meeting? It seems that this young man was just pretending to put up a logo, and he was also harmed by public opinion. 12 days, the young man is ruined",0

"This answer has a strong taste of agnosticism. In theory, every choice has variables. In fact, after considering various factors, the risk difference of each choice is very different. We don't need to force answers directly to those who come to Zhihu to ask for advice humbly, but try to teach them how to fish. Pretending to be profound and condescending is a bit sensational. Face the crisis directly and don't rely on luck. The process of maturity is painful. Don't try to escape. Everyone has his own responsibilities in life. Keep a clear mind.

"I personally think that school violence incidents have not been exaggerated. Incidents involving children have always been serious. The reason why they have been widely reported in recent years is, on the one hand, due to the rapid development of the Internet in my country and the speed of media dissemination. On the other hand, the importance and voice of children are being strengthened. Now most families have only one child, and their parents are intellectuals, so they naturally care about this aspect. Another reason is the awakening of legal awareness.",1
